=pod

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $kube = AnyEvent::Kubernetes->new(url=>'http://127.0.0.1:8080', username=>'dave', password=>'davespassword');
  $kube->list_pods(onSuccess => sub{
    my($pod_list) = @_;
  }, onError => sub {
    my($message) = @_;
    print "Ohh no!  An error occured: ".$message."\n";
  });

  $kube->list_pods(onChange => sub {
    my($pod) = @_;
  });

=head1 Standard Arguments

Most methods take a couple of standard arguments.

=over

=item onSuccess => sub { ... }

onSuccess is accepted by almost all methods, and will be invocked upon successfull completion of the operation.
The supplied callback will be passed the involved oject, either a Resource object or a ResourceList Object.

=item onError => sub {  }

onError is also accepted by almost all methods, and is simply the converse of onSuccess.
The supplied callback will be passed a message which could be a simple string, or a hasref.
Simple strings generally indicate a communication failure with the api server, a hashref would be the decoded response from
kubernetes.

=item onChange => sub { ... }

onChange is an optional argument to all "list" methods which will fundementally change the behavoir of the function,
and should not be used in conjunction with onSuccess.  When onChange is supplied, the resulting connection to kubernetes
api will be a streaming connection sending real time updates for changes to any of the resources in the resulting list.
The onChange callback will be evoked continuously every time a resource changes, and will be passed the resource object
which changed, as well as the type of change (ADDED|MODIFIED|DELETED). It will also be called once for each item in the list
(with a type of ADDED) immediately which will allow the building of an initial list.

=head2 List Filtering arguments

All "list" methods accept the following parameters to filter the list of returned resources.

=over

=item labels => {}

The supplied hashref of key value pairs will be translated into labelSelector's for the kubernetes api.

=item fields => {}

The supplied hashref of key value pairs will be translated into fieldSelector's for the kubernetes api.
